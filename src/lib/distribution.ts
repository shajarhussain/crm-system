 * Resolves the next assignee under the priority + 8-lead rotation rule
 * (BR-6, architecture.md §4.2) and returns the updated cycle state.
 *
 * The rule as implemented: the highest-priority active employee receives eight
 * leads, then the next priority receives eight, and so on; once the lowest
 * priority completes their eight the cycle resets and it starts again from
 * priority 1. Disabled employees are skipped without breaking the sequence.
 *
 * NOTE (PRD §8 open question 1): only auto-assignments advance these counters —
 * a lead the admin hands out manually inside the 5-minute window does not
 * consume anyone's eight. That is the behaviour the system already had; it is
 * flagged for client confirmation rather than changed here.
 *
 * `excludeUids` covers reassignment: an employee who has already been offered
 * this lead and let it expire is skipped for subsequent passes, but keeps their
 * cycle counter so their place in the rotation is not lost.
 *
 * Pure and total — no I/O, no clock, no randomness. See distribution.test.ts.
